[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

Comfortable, seamless, and fast 3-finger (and 4-finger) touchpad swipe gestures for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and beyond. May work for other Linux distros that support `libinput`.

## Installation

1. Install git, libinput, and g++

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install git libinput-tools libxdo-dev g++
    ```

2. Clone this repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Hikari9/comfortable-swipe.git --depth 1
    cd comfortable-swipe-ubuntu
    ```

3. Install

    ```bash
    bash install
    ```

4. You may delete the downloaded `comfortable-swipe-ubuntu` folder after installation.

## How to Run

1. You'll need some group permissions to read touchpad input data. Run
    ```bash
    sudo gpasswd -a $USER $(ls -l /dev/input/event* | awk '{print $4}' | head --line=1)
    ```
2. ***Important***: After inputing your `sudo` password, log out then log back in
3. Run
    ```
    comfortable-swipe start
    ```
4. _Optional_: Automatically run on startup
    ```
    comfortable-swipe autostart
    ```
5. Check the status of your application by running
    ```
    comfortable-swipe status
    ```

## Configurations
Comfortable swipe makes use of keyboard shortcuts for configurations. Edit by running
```
nano $(comfortable-swipe config)
```

Make sure to run after making changes:
```
comfortable-swipe restart
```

Property  | Description | Default Value | Default Behavior

threshold | mouse pixels to activate swipe; higher = less sensitive; floating-point (Note: Sky is the limit! Can be as large as 1000.0) | 0.0

Taken from `man xdotool`:

> Type a given keystroke. Examples being "alt+r", "Control_L+J",
> "ctrl+alt+n", "BackSpace".
>
> Generally, any valid X Keysym string will work. Multiple keys are
> separated by '+'. Aliases exist for "alt", "ctrl", "shift",
> "super", and "meta" which all map to Foo_L, such as Alt_L and
> Control_L, etc.
>
> In cases where your keyboard doesn't actually have the key you want
> to type, xdotool will automatically find an unused keycode and use
> that to type the key.

Refer to https://www.linux.org/threads/xdotool-keyboard.10528/ for a complete list of keycodes you can use.


## Debugging

You can check your touchpad driver by running

```bash
comfortable-swipe debug
```

This is an alias of `libinput debug-events`. This logs all gestures you make on your touchpad, along with other input-based events that can be captured by libinput.

A working swipe gesture will show the following:

```bash
$ comfortable-swipe debug
...

```

If you can see `GESTURE_SWIPE_XXX` in your output, that means your touchpad supports multi-touch swipe gestures.
